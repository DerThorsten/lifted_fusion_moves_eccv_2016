## Code for Isbi 2012 challenge 


Dowload data from http://brainiac2.mit.edu/isbi_challenge/home.
Run main.py. This will create a folder 'out' where intermediate result
and the final results are stored.

This is a reimplementation of the orginal source code used for the paper
since it was very messy. More then this one, trust me =)


Dependencies:
    You need a few non standart python packages:
        vigra  (https://github.com/ukoethe/vigra)
        nifty  (https://github.com/DerThorsten/nifty)
